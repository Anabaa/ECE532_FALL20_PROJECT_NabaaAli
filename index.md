## Welcome to the Heart disease diagnositic ML project Page
Cardiovascular disease includes a wide range of conditions affecting heart and arteries. In this project, a
publicly available dataset which consists of 70000 observations of potential patients is obtained from 
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset). The dataset is based on 11 features and
a label of whether the patient observed suffers from a cardiovascular disease (y = 1) or not (y = -1) . The attributes may be
categorized as objective, examination and subjective. Objective attributes are based on factual information,
while the subjective ones are basically information given by the patients themselves.

The main goal of this project is to utilize different machine learning algorithms to obtain a classifier for
predicting cardiovascular disease with reasonable accuracy. The main tasks are preprocessing the dataset,
training a learner using three different algorithms to classify whether a patient has a cardiovascular disease
and comparing the global performance of each algorithm using cross-validation scheme to avoid overfitting.
The dataset is to be divided into 7 sets, each with 10000 datapoints and shall be used interchangeably for
training and evaluation purposes. The algorithms to be learned are as follows:

• **Linear regression with least squares**

• **Ridge Regression and LASSO with cross-validation**

• **K-nearest neighbours**

• **Neural networks with 2 layers**
